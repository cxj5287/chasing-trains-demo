Urgh, my head...
...
Wait. Where am I? Beef...? Where, ow where are you? ...Beef?! Beef!
Eugh, what-! What happened to me?
God, what is that thing?
It's like some kind of bird demon, am I in... let's not think about that
Okay, okay, calm down, deep breaths.
Alright, so I was in the woods with Beef, and we were running to…we were going to...
God, I can’t remember! It was so dark…and then we…
...
Wait.. Beef! Where are you buddy?
I need to find him and figure out how to get out of here.
Euuegh! What is this? It's all slimy...
Oh hey, this is Beef’s leash! How did this get here?
We always keep it by the door, or uh, attached to him if we're going out
Except for that time he escaped to run after a squirrel. He really hates that thing.
Wait a minute, if this is Beef's leash, then...
Beef?
Omigosh, Beef!
Ahahaha you liddle tubster! Where did you get off to, big guy?
What happened to you little guy? I can kinda see through you. Well, I guess you can kinda see through me, too
*sad whine*
I've never been here before. Do you know where we are, or what's going on?
*sneeze* BOOF!
I'm glad I'm not the only one confused, at least.
Maybe there's something here that can explain where we are?
*happy bark* ARF! ARF!
Another one of these orb things... I wonder what they're doing here.
These are definitely Mom and Dad's, I don't get letters in the mail...
Except for my pen pal letters. Oh shoot I haven't responded in months! Gotta do that.
*barks in agreement*
Another orb! This is from when we went up to Liberty Falls! 
We hung it up in the staircase, so we’d remember hiking in the woods when we were hiking up the stairs. 
Hehe, it's silly but it worked. What's it doing here though?
I don't know what these things are, but I feel like I'm getting closer to understanding.
WOAH! That's new! Did I do that?
I think we need to bring these over there!
I don't know how I know, but I feel like something's coming together, like I'm on the edge of figuring something out.
YOU HOLD THE LEASH, YET YOU ARE TIED, AS THIS WORLD DISSECTS ALL THAT IS INSIDE.
YOU FLEE AND FIGHT THE LIFE TO COME, BUT IT CONSUMES YOU WHEN YOU RUN.
WHETHER LOST OR FOUND, THROUGH THE HOURGLASS’ SOUND, YOU ARE FOREVER BOUND.
Come on, Beef! Let's get out of here!
